                        <p>
                            Iâ€™m Product Designer and UX/UI Designer from Brazil currently working at Magazine Luiza.
                        </p>
                        <p>    
                            I have more than 10 years of experience, creating digital products for digital agencies, e-commerce,
                            software house, and helping startups from around the world turn ideas into innovative digital products.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I believe that access to information and technology creates a more just and inclusive world.
                            That is why my goal is to identify people's problems and needs and to solve them by designing and
                            implementing simple, creative, and objective solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, I live to travel and photograph.
                            I like to know new places, cultures, music and those responsible for all this ... people! ;)
