                        <p>
                            Iâ€™m UX/UI Designer & Product Designer from Brazil. I have more than 10 years of career, creating digital products for digital agencies, e-commerce, software house, and helping startups turn ideas into innovative digital products.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I believe that access to information and technology creates a more just and inclusive world. That is why my goal is to identify people's problems and needs and to solve them by designing and implementing simple, creative, and objective solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, I live to travel and photograph.
                            I like to know new places, cultures, music and those responsible for all this ... people! ;)
